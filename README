This device support based on ASYN/Streamdevice contains generic templates to 
control BME Delaygenerator PCI cards through the BME Delaygenerator server 
application.

It was tested with BME SG08p PCI cards. Other models might require some minor 
adjustment.

It comes with a simple ExampleIoc which can control a single BME system with
2 x BME SG08p PCI cards

####
## How to build
####
1. Set the path of your EPICS Base in 
./configure/RELEASE

2. Build the support module
$ make

3. Set the path of your EPICS Base, ASYN and Streamdevice in 
./ExampleIoc/configure/RELEASE

4. Build the IOC
make -C ./ExampleIoc/

5. Set the IP used by drvAsynIPPortConfigure in 
./ExampleIoc/iocBoot/ioc/st.cmd

6. Start the IOC
$ cd ./ExampleIoc/iocBoot/ioc
$ ./st.cmd

7. Open the edm panel for control:
$ cd ./dl
$ edm -x -m "DEVN=EXAMPLE" BmeDelGenMain.EXAMPLE.edl

## Upper/Lower limits of clock related commands
####

The clock period and internal clock are defined by the input clock (InpClk) and prescaler / multiplier settings.
The limits can be described as the following:
MaxInpClk: 600MHz
MinInpClkPeriod: 1.66ns
MaxIntlClk: 125MHz (depending on Prescaler and Multiplier)
MinIntlClkPeriod: 8ns

MinInpClk: 10MHz/128 = 78.125kHz
MinIntlClk: 10MHz (MinInputClock with Multiplier of 128)
MaxIntlClkPeriod: 100ns

# Limits of specific commands:

DLAW (PulseWidth):
- Max = MaxInt32 * MaxIntlClkPeriod = 2147483647 * 100ns = 214.748s
- Min = MinIntlClkPeriod / 2 = 4ns (minimum is the half step, higher values require full steps e.g. 8ns, 16ns etc.)

FORC
- Max = MaxInt32 * MaxIntlClkPeriod = 2147483647 * 100ns = 214.748s
- Min = -1 (off), minimal step width  is MinIntlClkPeriod = 8ns

INHB
- Max = MaxInt32 * MaxIntlClkPeriod = 2147483647 * 100ns = 214.748s
- Min = -1 (off), minimal step width  is MinIntlClkPeriod = 8ns

STBK
- Max = MaxInt32 * MaxIntlClkPeriod = 2147483647 * 100ns = 214.748s
- Min = -1 (off), minimal step width  is MinIntlClkPeriod = 8ns

GDEL (delay of gate signal):
- Max = 63 * MaxIntlClkPeriod = 63 * 100ns = 6,3μs
- Min =  0 (off), minimal step width is MinInpClkPeriod = 1.66ns

DLAY
This is actually a formula, so no hard HOPR and LOPR values are set in the EPICS database template. For for scalar values and calculation results the limits are defined as:
- Max = MaxInt32 * MaxIntlClkPeriod = 2147483647 * 100ns = 214.748s
- Min = 0 (no Delay) 25ps Steps

Note: The list only show the possible maximums and minimums. The current maximum and minimum for each command depends on the current internal clock period.
The higher or lower inputs will be rounded to the current limits which can be seen in the readback values.
