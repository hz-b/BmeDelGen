This device support based on ASYN/Streamdevice contains generic templates to 
control BME Delaygenerator PCI cards through the BME Delaygenerator server 
application.

It was tested with BME SG08p PCI cards. Other models might require some minor 
adjustment.

It comes with a simple ExampleIoc which can control a single BME system with
2 x BME SG08p PCI cards

# How to build:
1. Set the path of your EPICS Base in 
./configure/RELEASE

2. Build the support module
$ make

3. Set the path of your EPICS Base, ASYN and Streamdevice in 
./ExampleIoc/configure/RELEASE

4. Build the IOC
make -C ./ExampleIoc/

5. Set the IP used by drvAsynIPPortConfigure in 
./ExampleIoc/iocBoot/ioc/st.cmd

6. Start the IOC
$ cd ./ExampleIoc/iocBoot/ioc
$ ./st.cmd

7. Open the edm panel for control:
$ cd ./dl
$ edm -x -m "DEVN=EXAMPLE" BmeDelGenMain.EXAMPLE.edl
